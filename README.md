# Crabmania

Game tailored for [Weekly Game Jam - Week 162](https://itch.io/jam/weekly-game-jam-162).

Currently under development.

## Devlog Day 01 - 14.08.2020

I created a crab model and basic environment shaders for sea and beach sand darkening on edges. Also I implemented feature for rotating the base of the crab based on ground normal, making the crab "standing" on the ground correctly with initial movement mechanic.
