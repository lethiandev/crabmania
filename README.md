## Devlog Day 02 - 15.08.2020

Made some fixes and adjustments.

* Fixed wet sand shader by sharpening the edges blending.

## Devlog Day 01 - 14.08.2020

I created a crab model and basic environment shaders for sea and beach sand darkening on edges. Also I implemented feature for rotating the base of the crab based on ground normal, making the crab "standing" on the ground correctly with initial movement mechanic.
